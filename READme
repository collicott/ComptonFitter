This project will fit the spin polarisabilities using APLCON - a constrained least square fitter by Volker Blobel. As APLCON is written in Fortran, a c++ wrapper was written by Andreas Neiser, known as APLCON++. The code is available here:

https://github.com/A2-Collaboration-dev/APLCON

APLCON++, and ROOT cern are required. 


Setting up Pascalutsa software
------------------------------------
For privacy reasons, the compiled versions of Vladimir Pascalutsa's EFT code have *not* been included here. Please obtain these from Pascalutsa directly! You should get two specific files 
(1) runComptonEFT -- a shell script for setting up the program
(2) ComptonEFT    -- compiled executable

- Create a directory, within "ComptonFitter" called ComptonEFT
- Move these two files into the directory
- Make sure the files are executable
- good to go
